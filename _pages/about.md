My name is Andrew Burford, and I'm currently working towards a BS in Computer Science. Having had a passion for computers since a young age, I started my first programming projects in high school. I taught myself some basic programming and wrote my first published iOS application sophomore year. I started taking formal programming classes and by senior year I was volunteering at my school to be a full stack web developer for their internal websites. During my last 2 months of high school, I developed a system to allow students to securely mark their attendance in class using an iOS application, web backend, and Raspberry Pi with bluetooth. Since then, I've worked as an IT programmer for an advertising firm and as a High Performance Computing Engineer at Stony Brook University.

I am also an Eagle Scout. In addition to helping me acquire strong leadership and communication skills, scouting also instilled in me a profound appreciation for the outdoors. I love hiking, camping, kayaking, climbing, rafting, mountain biking, and everything in between. The picture above is from a solo bikepacking trip I did this past summer from Stony Brook to Montauk. My favorite sport, however, is running. Running has been a part of my daily schedule for many years now, and this school year I'm serving as the President of Stony Brook Running Club.
