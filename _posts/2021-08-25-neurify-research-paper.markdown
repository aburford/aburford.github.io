My last semester of undergrad, I took a graduate course called [Hybrid
Systems and Trusted
Autonomy](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/cse510fall2021)
which included an individual semester long research project of my own choosing. I
decided to research the most recent developments in the field of
neural network verification. I was particularly interested in the
algorithm presented in the paper [Efficient Formal Safety Analysis of
Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08098), implemented in a
software package called Neurify. I noticed that the Neurify algorithm
could be extended to be compatible with the sigmoid activation
function. I implemented this modification to the algorithm and wrote a
research paper summarizing my findings.
