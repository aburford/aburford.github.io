This was my final project for CSE 160 Computer Science A Honors. It is a spinoff of the popular board game Pentago. Players must place a marble on the board and rotate a quadrant each turn (unless there exist any rotationally symmetric quadrants). In classic Pentago, a 6 x 6 board is used and the first player to get 5 in a row wins. Hexago allows players to select any dimension from 2 x 2 to 16 x 16 and select a required number of marbles in a row to win. I used JavaFX for the graphics.
