Run Logger allows runners to easily track and record your runs right from your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch.
### The Application
Run Logger interfaces with the LogARun website (no affiliation) to store all of your runs. Here are some of the basic features offered by Run Logger:
* Store a variety of metrics for each run, including which pair of shoes were used to calculate shoe mileage
* View and comment on runs from your teammates
* Keep track of weekly mileage, providing suggestions to to hit a weekly goal
* Smart notifications reminding you to log your run if you haven't already
* Full HeathKit integration for retrieving saved running metrics
* Background refresh to automatically save runs from HealthKit
* Customize LogARun account settings

### The Development Process
I started writing this app my sophomore year of high school because I wanted to learn how to write mobile applications and be able to easily log my runs from my phone. I hadn't taken any formal coding classes at this point, so I began teaching myself everything from scratch. I read about Object Oriented Programming, Model View Controller design pattern, networking requests, and more. I realized that learning anything is much easier when you have a clear goal in mind. Each new concept I picked up, I could immediately put into action writing this application. I finished it up in the beginning of my junior year and got it published on the iOS App Store. Due to not wanting to pay annual developer fees, it is unfortunately no longer available to download, but you can see more details about it [here](https://appadvice.com/app/run-logger-powered-by-logarun/1153208744).
